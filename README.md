# School_District_Analysis
## Project Overview

An initial data set of 15 schools was provided for performance analysis of Math and Reading scores.  Data was to be cleaned and sorted for extensive drill down by various categorizations including School Type, Size and Per Capita Spending.  For the project, a portion of the data from the Thomas High School 9th Grade Student Scores was deemed unfit and a secondary analysis was needed with the unfit data removed.  Overall the project analysis sought to display potential relationships between student performance and the School Type, Size and Per Capita Spending with the updated data set.
